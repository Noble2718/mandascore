            <h1>What is this?</h1>
            <p>
                This is an app for viewing and editing Mandachord songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The main motivation was to provide a way to be able to copy my songs into the game without having to
                pause a video.  But while I was at it I went ahead and made it a full blown editor.
            </p>
            <h2>Mandachord song codes?</h2>
            <p>
                There actually is a Mandachord song code format.  If you link a song in chat, and then look at your
                EE.log file after quitting Warframe, then you will see something like this:
            </p>
            <code>
                [SONG-Best Song Ever:AADDnwAAEggAAIggAEGBAJCAAABIAAAYAAgFwAECkCAgiAAAKEEACYAhAoAAAAgAAQgICCHAgQCQAEEIAABIQgAJgCEEgAAASAAIGAAABYAAIYAIIQgAAEgCBEGAABCAAAAIAAEIAAhBwgEAkA==:BardCorpusPackA:BardGrineerPackA:BardCorpusPackB]
            </code>
            <p>
                You used to be able to paste this back into the in-game chat window and get a song link back, but
                unfortunately that hasn't worked in a couple of years.  Still, it's as good a format as any, so that's
                what this editor is using.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a program for extracting song codes from your EE.log file, if you're comfortable with
                running python: <a href="https://github.com/buff0000n/songparse">songparse</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you came here from a song link then it should already be displayed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you have a song code then paste it in the <strong>Song Code</strong> text box and hit enter.
            </p>

            <h1 id="tocEditing">Basic Editing</h1>
            <p>
                If you're familiar with the in-game Mandachord editor then you already know how most of this works.
            </p>
            <h2 id="tocTitle">Title</h2>
            <p>
                Enter the title of the song here.  The in-game restrictions on Mandachord song titles are pretty
                severe, but the only thing being restricted here is a 24 character limit
            </p>
            <h2 id="tocInstruments">Instruments</h2>
            <p>
                You can adjust the settings here for each section individually: Percussion, Bass, and Melody.
            </p>
            <h3 id="tocInstrumentSet">Instrument Set</h3>
            <p>
               Use the dropdown to choose one of the nine instrument sets.
            </p>
            <h3 id="tocVolume">Volume</h3>
            <p>
                Use the slider to adjust the volume.  Full volume is all the way to thr right, zero volume is all the
                way to the left.
            </p>
            <h3 id="tocIsolation">Isolation</h3>
            <p>
                Use the checkboxes on the right to turn particular sections on and off.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that the isolation settings are not part of the song code and don't get saved.
            </p>
            <h2 id="tocNotes">Notes</h2>
            <p>
                The rest of the screen is dedicated to the note grid.  This is laid out just like the Mandachord
                screen, except as a rectangle instead of a disc.
            <p>
                The top three rows are percussion, the next five are bass, and the bottom five are melody.  Time
                ordering goes from left to right.
            </p>
            <p>
                Click a location in the grid to turn a note on, or click a location with an existing note to turn that
                note off.  You can also click and drag across an area to create multiple notes next to each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                The score is broken out into four measures.  Each measure has a maximum number of notes that can be
                present in each section:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Percussion</strong>: 24 notes per measure</li>
                <li><strong>Bass</strong>: 16 notes per measure</li>
                <li><strong>Melody</strong>: 16 notes per measure</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong class="warn">Exceeding the note limit on a section of a measure will play a small warning sound.</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                If your screen is wide enough then all four measures will be displayed in a single row.
                If your screen is not wide enough for that, then there will be two rows of two.
                If your screen is not wide enough for that the four measures will be arranged vertically.
            </p>
            <h1 id="tocAdvancedEditing">Advanced Editing</h1>
            <h2 id="tocClear">Clear</h2>
            <h3 id="tocClearMeasure">Clear Measure</h3>
            <p>
                Above each measure is a <strong>Clear</strong> button.  This can be used to clear part or all of the
                measure.  Clicking <strong>Clear</strong> will bring up a menu:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>All</strong>: Use this to completely clear the measure</li>
                <li><strong>Percussion</strong>: Use this to clear just the Percussion section of the measure</li>
                <li><strong>Bass</strong>: Use this to clear just the Bass section of the measure</li>
                <li><strong>Melody</strong>: Use this to clear just the Melody section of the measure</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 id="tocClearSong">Clear Song</h3>
            <p>
                Above the <strong>Song Title</strong> bar is another <strong>Clear</strong> button.  This allows you to
                clear notes from all four measures.  It has the same options as the per-measure <strong>Clear</strong>
                button: <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Percussion</strong>, <strong>Bass</strong>, or
                <strong>Melody</strong>.
            </p>
            <h2 id="tocCopy">Copy</h2>
            <p>
                Above each measure is a <strong>Copy</strong> button.  This can be used to copy part or all of the
                measure, allowing it to be pasted to a different measure.  Clicking the <strong>Copy</strong> button
                will bring up the usual section options: <strong>All</strong>, <strong>Percussion</strong>,
                <strong>Bass</strong>, or <strong>Melody</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once a section is selected, it will be outlined in that measure.  If any changes are made to that
                section, or if the <strong>Copy</strong> button is clicked again, then the selection will be cleared.
            </p>
            <h2 id="tocPaste">Paste</h2>
            <p>
                Once a copy selection is made in one measure, the <strong>Paste</strong> buttons are enabled on the
                other three measures.  Clicking the <strong>Paste</strong> button will copy the selected section from
                the copied measure into that measure, overwriting any existing notes in that section.
            </p>
            <h1 id="tocUndoRedo">Undo/Redo</h1>
            <p>
                Undo and Redo is available using either the <strong>Undo</strong> and <strong>Redo</strong> buttons
                above the <strong>Song Title</strong> bar, or by using <strong>Ctrl-Z</strong> for undo and
                <strong>Ctrl-Shift-Z</strong> or <strong>Ctrl-Y</strong> for redo.
            </p>
            <p>
                All actions can be undone, including note changes, section setting changes, title changes, paste,
                clear, and loading a demo song.
            </p>
            <h1 id="tocPlayback">Playback</h1>
            <p>
                Use the <strong>Play buttons</strong> to start and stop playback on either all or part of the song.
                Playback will loop back to the beginning until stopped.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like in game, the current playback location is marked with a vertical line, and individual notes
                will have a small visual bounce as they are played.
            </p>
            <p>
                Pressing <strong>Space</strong> during playback will pause at its current location.  Pressing
                <strong>Space</strong> again will resume playback where it left off.

            <h1 id="tocInstrumentSetNotes">Instrument Set Notes</h1>
            <h2 id="tocAdau">Adau</h2>
            <p>
                The default instrument is ironically one of the hardest to work with.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> is different from all the other instrument sets.  It's a low drum, a
                double-drum, and a high drum.  The double-drum is unique: a single note actually plays twice, a
                sixteenth note apart.  Putting a series of middle-drum notes one grid square apart will play a
                continuous drum roll.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found the best way to work with Adau percussion is to use the high and low drums as the basis
                of the rhythm, and the middle double-drum supporting the other two as a lead-in or filler.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is the only bass in the current instrument set lineup that's pitched high and
                clear enough to do chords.  That's usually how I use it.  Unfortunately, because it's pitched so high,
                and because I'm usually doubling up with chords, it tends to drown out most melodies.  For that reason
                I usually back the volume off a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is very, very mushy.  Single notes are very hard to distinguish a clear
                start time.  Fast notes just blend together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The one place where the Adau melody shines is emulating long-held notes.  Because of the mushiness,
                repeating a note every grid space will blend together into a single, long note.  Adau is the only
                melody that can do this well.  You can also quickly alternate between 2-3 notes and get a similar
                effect as a long-held chord.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocAlpha">Alpha</h2>
            <p>
                The Alpha instrument set is 100% Techno.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> has a very distinctive 80's techno bass drum, but it should be used
                sparingly unless you're going for an obnoxious "hard-bass" style.  The snare is a relatively
                high-pitched whip-crack snare, also best used sparingly.  The hi-hat is one of the strongest in the
                line-up, but not overwhelming.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've found the best way to use the Alpha percussion is to keep it simple with the bass and snare, and
                save the creativity for the hi-hat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> notes take about half a measure to play out and aren't very strong.  This is
                more of a atmospheric bass than something you can make a recognizable bass line out of.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is one of the best overall melodies in the line-up.  Each note takes about
                2-3 grid spaces to play out, so it's not great for fast melodies.  Otherwise it's very strong and
                clear.  I use it a lot for mid-range, slower melodies that I want to be recognizable.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocBeta">Beta</h2>
            <p>
                Beta is one of the more low-key instrument sets.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> bass and hi-hat are relatively gentle.  I tend to use them if the song
                I'm trying to adapt doesn't have percussion at all.  The snare, on the other hand, is pretty aggressive.
                In some of my longer videos I use the Beta snare in place of a crash cymbal.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is very low, almost sub-audible.  You feel it more than you hear it.  You can
                do a pretty chill bass line with it, but people aren't really going to be able to recognize it as
                anything.  It's also pretty good at doing a long-held bass note if you repeat it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> kind of suffers from the out-of-tune sound, but it's pretty short not
                counting the echo.  It's a decent choice for fast melodies, and the echo can fill in slower ones.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my default substitute melody for Piano.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocDelta">Delta</h2>
            <p>
                Delta is kind of an oddball.  I use its percussion a lot, but I almost never touch its bass or melody.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> has a strong, short snare that I use a lot for drum and bass and a
                couple of EDM styles.  The bass and hi-hat fit well but aren't anything special, I mostly use this
                for the snare.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is both very disinctive and hard to deal with.  The main sound is delayed
                enough that you have to place it a grid square ahead of when you want it to actually play.  When it
                plays its sound cuts through everything, you usually have to knock the volume back to hear anything
                else.
            </p>
            <p>
                I just never end up using this bass.  You need a really good sound match before it makes sense over any
                of the other bass options.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong>.  Personally, I've never heard the Delta melody used in-game in any way
                <i>other</i> than to be as obnoxious as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is possible to make something interesting and okay to listen to.  But you have to spend a lot of
                time playing with the five notes and seeing how they can blend together.  They all sound very different,
                and bear only a passing resemblance to the scale note they represent.  The bottom four take almost
                half a measure to play out, but the top note is faster can get away with being played quicker.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocDruk">Druk</h2>
            <p>
                Druk is heavy metal all the way
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> is very strong and loud.  Since you can't vary the volume it comes
                off a little too strong if you really hammer on it like a heavy metal drummer, but it's not usually
                a problem.  For any music with a live drummer it's usually either Druk or Plogg, depending on
                how heavy it is.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is my favorite bass in the line-up.  It's clear and short.  You can build
                a huge variety of complicated bass lines.  It cuts through battle noise very well in game.  Sometimes
                if you've got a very busy bass against a weaker melody you'll want to cut the volume a bit.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is easily my most used bass.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is kind of mushy, and also an octave below most of the other melodies in
                the line-up.  If I try and do a busy melody line with this then I'll always double it up on the bass
                to give it more definition.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have a pretty hard time hearing the Druk melody when I'm in mission, so I usually keep it simple.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocEpsilon">Epsilon</h2>
            <p>
                Epsilon is EDM with a more Eurobeat-feel to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> has among the longest snare and hi-hat sounds, good for filling a
                lot of space or cutting through other sounds.  The bass drum is low and long as well, but my reasons
                for using Epsilon percussion are mostly for the snare and hi-hat.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is hard to work with because it's a dual sound.  First a low note, then one
                grid square later a higher, clearer note.  I find this works best when you place it a grid square
                before where you want it to sound.  The higher part also tends to overshadow some melodies, making it
                even tougher to use effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is an octave or more above all the other melodies in the line-up.  It takes
                a whole quarter note to fully play out, but it doesn't get mushy with faster melodies.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is my go-to choice for high-pithed melodies, including high strings.
            <p>
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocGamma">Gamma</h2>
            <p>
                Gamma is mainly for hip-hop, but the melody is extremely versatile.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> is my go-to for any rap or hip-hip.  It has a very strong hi-hat, and
                a high pitched snare that's almost like a hand-clap.  The bass drum is pretty standard but fits
                with the theme.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is a low brass note that takes about a quarter-note to play out.  You can't
                do fast bass-lines, but you can fill space with it.  Most of the time, if I'm doing hip-hop then I end
                up doubling up the base on the bass drum rhythm.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is my go-to melody for anything fast-paced.  Aside from a little but of
                de-tuning, it's short and clear and great for just about anything with a lot of sixteenth notes.
            </p>
            <p>
                It's a toss-up whether Gamma or Alpha is my most used melody.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocHoros">Horos</h2>
            <p>
                Horos is the community-voted "EDM" pack which... I mean, half the instrument sets in the
                line-up qualify as "EDM".  The community is dumb sometimes, but it's a good instrument set.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> bass drum and snare make a solid club beat.  I find myself just doing
                bass drum on the beast and snare every other beat a lot with this instrument set.  The only unfortunate
                thing is the hi-hat, which is so weak it's almost inaudible compared to the rest.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is my second-favorite bass after druk.  It's short and clear, and you can
                do tons of stuff with it.  I find myself using it a lot for repetitive synth-wave bass lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is pretty hard to use.  Each note has is a built-in chord, a ton of
                overtones, and echoes for a good 3/4 of a measure.  The best way to use this is sparingly.
            </p>

            <h2 id="tocPlogg">Plogg</h2>
            <p>
                Plogg is kind of a lighter rock, except the bass player keeps his amp turned up way too loud even
                though they keep asking him to dial it back.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> is a pretty standard live drum kit.  Its strength is that it's so
                generic that it fits in everywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is the loudest in the line-up.  Honestly, when I use this bass I usually
                turn it down to half-volume.  It takes two grid squares to sound out, so it's not for fast bass lines.
            </p>
            <p>
                The one exception is if I need a long-held bass note that's as hardcore loud as possible.  Repeating a
                Plogg bass note like with the Adau melody works pretty good for that.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong>, like Druk, is an octave below most of the other melodies.  I use this
                a lot for low male vocals, and the occasional clean guitar.  It takes two grid squares to sound out
                so it's not great for fast melodies.

                The instrument set request I hear the most is "piano".  So here's my concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> is smooth jazz, because even Plogg is still too heavy for some songs.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is high and clear enough to play chords.  The only other bass that can do that right now is
                Adau.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>melody</strong> is an octave higher than most of the other melodies.  We don't have enough of those and most
                piano requests I get fall into that range.

                I would love a reto-gaming chiptune instrument set.  So here's my concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>percussion</strong> is based on a Commodore 64, the earliest thing I could think of that
                can pull off a distinct bass drum.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>bass</strong> is from some Super Breakout clone I used to play.  I can't remember the
                platform but I can hear that ball bouncing sound very clearly in my head.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted something high and chill for the <strong>melody</strong>, because we don't really have
                anything like that yet.  I guess it turned out a little Nintendo-esque?

                   Maybe some icons instead of word buttons for play, stop, copy, paste, undo, redo.

                <li>
                    Searchable database with my existing song library.  No idea how I'm going to do this.

                    In-game, a lot of the individual instrument notes have at least two different sounds that they
                    alternate between to avoid being 100% repetitive, especially the percussion notes.  That's more
                    time that I wanted to spend in the virtual recording studio, so I just included one sound per note.
                </li>
                <li>
                    There may be some delay when playing an instrument pack for the first time.  This is because of
                    the safeguards a lot of browsers have in place to prevent auto-play video and audio.  There isn't
                    much I can do about it.  You have to click something before it can even load the sounds.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The playback note animations sometimes cause Firefox to continually reload the note images
                    over and over again.
                </li>
                <li>
                    With Safari and possibly iOS, minimizing or otherwise hiding the window while it's playing will
                    stop the audio.  When you come back it takes a few tries playing and stopping before it fully
                    returns.  I'm not quite sure what's going on there yet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Not sure if it's just my phone, but playback on Chrome for Android kind of sucks.
